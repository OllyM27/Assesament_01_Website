	<h2>Background Information</h2>
		<p>
			To start things off here is a little bit of background knowledge about me, my name is Oliver I am 26 years old and have been in the hospitality industry since finishing high school. I was born in Mallorca Spain and grew up there until the age of 8 years old. From there I moved with my parents to Southeast Asia to Laos for 6 years due to their business requirements. In 2010 I migrated to Australia and attended high school in a small beach town called Noosa. Upon finishing high school, I moved to Melbourne to study screens and media with RMIT. While undertaking those studies I was working part time in a restaurant. I went forward and completed my studies with RMIT and decided to go to college and graduate as Chef. Since then, I have climbed up the ladder through the ranks and am helping over see a busy venue here in Melbourne.
			In my pass times I enjoy discovering new and exciting venues that Melbourne has to offer and trying what they have. I also have deep love for gaming and enjoy parking myself on the couch and playing with my partner.

	<h2>Interest in Information Technology</h2>
		<p>
			From as a long as I can remember technology as always been an interest to me. I remember as a child my parents bringing home our first computer, and I was blowen away by all the amazing things this giant box could do. This thing was big and blocky and probably weighed more than me at the time, but I remember being fascinated by it. That same year my father bought me my first video game “Sonic the hedgehog” this is when my love for gaming began. Since then, over the years, I have continued to love playing video games and modding them in every way possible. However, gaming is not my only interest in the I.T world. Even from an early age I have spent countless hours watching tech tips and tech review on YouTube, always wanting to know and understand more about new tech and software coming out on the market. This ranges from PC builds to basic HTML and programming. You could say that I have always had a deep curiosity when it comes to I.T, and here I am Studying at RMIT.
		</p>

	<h5>RMIT</h5>
		<p>
	I chose to study with RMIT because I had attended the institute back in 2017 and was pleased with the support and facilities available at the time. I also chose RMIT because it has one of the best reputations for undertaking academic education in Australia for Information Technology. Also, since I currently reside and work in Melbourne, I thought there was not better place to undertake my studies than with RMIT due to it being based out of Melbourne as well.
		</p>

	<h5>Expectations</h5>
		<p>
			My expectations upon completing my studies in Information Technology with RMIT is to be equipped with the knowledge and confidence to start a new career and chapter in my life. As I am just taking my fist step into the industry, I am unsure which specific path I will take in the I.T world. However, cyber security has piqued an interest in me for some time now and I hope to gain greater knowledge of the subject throughout my studies. I also want to make connections in the industry whilst studying and land my fist internship with a company within the I.T sector when graduating from this course.

	<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
	<h3>Myers-Briggs-Test</h3>
		<p>
			There are several tests that are conducted within a job interview process in many corporations when finding the right candidate for the job. One of those tests is the Myers-Briggs test (MBTI).
			My Myers-Briggs test Results:
		</p>
		<img src="Assesment_01_images/Test_Results.png" width="703" height="672" alt=""/>

	<h5>Learning Style Test</h5>
		<p>
			Another great test that can be conducted by a corporation to find the right candidate is a learning style test. Here are my results on a learning style test:
		</p>

	<img src="Assesment_01_images/Image_02.png" width="934" height="331" alt=""/>

	<h5>Personality Test</h5>
		<p>
			The third test that many companies conduct in an interview is the Personality test. This is used to distinguish different traits a person has, and to see if they will adjust to the new environment and new co-workers. Here are my results on the personality test:
		</p>

	<img src="Assesment_01_images/Screenshot 2022-06-02 173720.png" width="937" height="793" alt=""/>


	<h5>What do the results of these tests mean?</h5>
		<p>
			Upon completing the Myers-Briggs test, learning style assessment, and a personality test I have gained a wider view of what some of my traits and personality is like. All three tests results show that I am more of an introvert, and I prefer to think things through and asses a situation before acting upon it. The learning test also shows that I am a much more of a visual learner, rather than auditory learner.
		</p>

	<h5>How do these results influence my behaviour in a team?</h5>
		<p>
			Being a more introverted person who is more thought oriented, observant and reflective can have its pros and cons. Some of the pros are, when I approached a situation, I usually give / act on a more precise decision or answer, rather than spilling out everything on my mind. Some of the cons are, I do not engage enough in social interactions and discussions with pears on topics. This can unintentionally portray me as uninterested or cold and resulting in me not interreacting in topics and discussions in teamwork environment. Being a visual learner means I need to see a demonstration of the act/procedure for me to fully take in all necessary steps. I usually only need to be shown things once and I can conduct the task with ease. However, if someone is explaining a complex situation or task without a visual aid I usually do not take in all necessary information.
		</p>

	<h5>Accounting for my personality when forming a team</h5>
		<p>
			When forming a team, I need to consider my specific personally type and traits that may clash with others. Being more introverted I need to try and engage more with my team and push myself out of my comfort zone to interact in discussions and decisions. Also need to consider that not everyone learns the same way, some may learn visually like myself, some learn through explanation and discussion. When forming a team, I hope to help use everyone’s different strengths, personalities to strengthen the team as a whole.

	<h1>Project Idea</h1>
		<p>
			In the hospitality industry there is a substantial portion of chefs that struggle with time management and the knowledge to effectively cost menu items to return a respectable profit. The proposed idea for this I.T project is to create a smart phone app that all chefs at any level in their professional cooking career can use. The app will allow you to make from scratch any recipe you desire on the go in any place anywhere. You will also be able to effectively cost each menu item correctly with no prior experience needed.
		<p/>


		<p>
			After working in the hospitality industry for just over 5 years I worked in a variety of different venues. All of them have the same problem in common, as a chef you are asked to work long and stressful hours while maintaining the highest level of cooking standards. Not only do you have to produce exceptional food, but you also must create and cost menu items fast and efficiently to make a decent profitable return. My motivation on creating a mobile app that allows you to create and cost menu items on the go is due to my experience in the matter. Others and I in the industry are constantly struggling to find the opportunity and time to leave the kitchen and work on recipes and menu costing. Having access to an app on your phone that allows you to do this would be of immense help. Allowing you to make theses adjustment while being able to stay in the kitchen and oversee service at the same time would make everyday life much easier.
		</p>

		<p>
			Creating and adjusting recipes on the go through the convince of your smartphone would be of significant help for all chefs. This application will have a simple and not overcrowded interface that allows anyone at any level to make/adjust menu items with ease. When creating a dish, you need to keep in mind a number of factors in order for it to be profitable. This app will include features such as GP (gross profit) on each recipe created and will project an estimated amount before finalising each item. COGS (Cost of goods sold) will also be integrated into the application; this is a vital step that needs to be considered when making a recipe. Almost every dish created has wastage from the raw produce purchased to being converted into the completed menu item. Therefore, wastage will also be implemented into the application to get a more precise costing result. Labour is also another factor that needs to consideration when preparing menu items. The app will contain a labour calculation as well to estimate how much it will cost for a chef to spend time on each item from beginning to end. Pos ID’s (Point of Sale) will also be applied to app. In a venue each menu item has a unique Pos ID, this allows the till systems to know which item has been ordered/purchased, the Pos ID also shows the amount purchased on the final bill.
		<p/>

		<p>
			Not only will the application contain all expenses tracking, but it will also need to contain units of measurement, food distribution suppliers, and more. When creating or alerting recipes within the application, there will be a template to fill out that will include:
		<p/>

		<p>
				Brand (Supplier)
				Product code
				Description
				Inventory group
				Package size
				Unit type
				Number of units used
				Price per kg/Unit
				Unit per package e.g., ml, kg, ctn
				Unit of measurement e.g., ml, grams, each
				Ingredient cost
		<p/>

		<p>
			Upon filling out all the above requisitions and the expenses, and costing section, the app will print out a summery with each section in detail. This will give you an estimate of the total cost of what the item will be when finalised on the plate. Having this summery in front of you with all the expenses and items used within the recipe will help you meet your desired GP (gross profit). Also containing a section such as an “Inventory Group” allows the user to find and add menu items to their stocktaking and inventory management.
		<p/>

		<p>
			The app will also let the user to store all your crated recipes and categorise them into seasonal menus and events. Having this feature permits you to use popular recipes from previous menus to be implemented into new ones.
		<p/>

		<p>
			This application will be primarily made for android uses for the time being. However, the application will be made available for Apple users in the future too. To create this smartphone app for android users there will be several software applications used in the process. Some of these software’s that would need to be used are Java Development Kit (JDK), Software development kit (SDK) prefrailty from google, Eclipse Android Developer Tools (ADT) plugin. Also, the use of adobe photoshop or illustrator could be used to import personalised art and backgrounds within the interface.
		<p/>

		<p>
			The required skills needed to undertake this project would be a good amount of knowledge in coding within different languages such as, C# and Java. Also, knowledge in web development languages such as CSS and HTML would be beneficial. Being acquainted with mobile application programming interfaces (API) such as Android, windows mobile and Apple IOS would be necessary. Also, adequate advertisement would be necessary if the application where to be made available to the public. Also testing, testing and more testing would be necessary before made available, there are far too many apps currently out there on the market that suffer from a lack of testing. Unfortunately, I personally do not have all these skills required to complete this app and would need to seek outside help to complete the project. This would result in me finding adequate funding, a lot of self-teaching with trial and error and help from others to make this come true.
		<p/>

		<p>
			The verdict upon the completion of the mobile application if successful will mean that chefs can create and alter recipes with ease. Been able to quickly change and create menu items form the comfort of your mobile device would give chefs much more flexibility in their busy schedules. The main issue that many chefs face is not being able to leave the kitchen and leave younger chefs on their own during service to work on other projects. Having the flexibility to undertake admin work like this from within the kitchen environment solves this problem. Also working on new recipes within the kitchen environment gives the user a better visual aid when adjusting food items, opposed to estimating quantities in front of a computer.
